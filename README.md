# Completion to the cs50 2025 course, but I use Go in place of C.
Original problem can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/weeks/

CS50 has been around for a long time, and has made their problem sets and lectures online and free for anyone. I once
completed the problems from 2015 and wanted to revisit 10 years later to do it again. Only, this time I use Go for
the section on C.

This repo is groups problem by week in its own directory. Each week has a weekX.md file summarising the 
exercises (for full explanation, see the harvard.edu link). My implementations diverge slightly by using tests instead
of checking output in the terminal. In some cases tests are overly tedious to write, so manual confirmation is done 
instead.

Week 1-5 (Go): Arrays, Algorithms, Memory, Data Structures
Week 6-7: Python, SQL
Week 8: HTML, CSS, JS
Week 9: Flask (Python)
Week 10: Project

TODO:
- finish week 4, 5
- READMEs with instructions for week 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Rewrite weeks 1-3 to be more shorthanded, people can go to the official pages if they want
