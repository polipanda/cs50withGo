# Completion to the cs50 2025 course, but I use Go in place of C.
Original course can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/weeks/

CS50 has been around for a long time, and has made their problem sets and lectures online and free for anyone. I once
completed the problems from 2018, and decided to check out the updated course in 2025. Only, this time I use Go for
the sections on C.

This repo groups problems by week directories. Each week has a weekX.md file summarising the exercises (for full 
explanations, see the harvard.edu link at the top). My implementations diverge slightly by using tests to validate
outcomes instead of using user input and manually checking. In some cases tests are overly tedious to write, so manual 
confirmation is done instead.

Focus of each week:
Week 1-5: (Go) Basics, Arrays, Algorithms, Memory, Data Structures
Week 6: Python
Week 7: SQL
Week 8: HTML, CSS, JS
Week 9: (Python) Flask
Week 10: Final Project
