                'broken-toe': `In the move LOTR: The Two Towers, Aragorn kicks a helmet in frustration believing
                    Merry and Pippin had died. The actor, Viggo Mortensen, actually broke two toes, so the scream you
                    hear in the movie is a real scream from both pain and acting.`,
                pippin: `Pippin has a kill assist on 4 high powered individuals (Maiar). First, dropping the skeleton
                    down the well in Moria caused thousands of orcs to descend on them, and a Balrog of Morgoth. This
                    eventually leads to the deaths of Gandalf and the Balrog. Second, Pipping convinces the Treebeard
                    to travel south past Isengard, which leads to the downfall of Saruman and his death. Lastly, when
                    Pippin looks in the Palantir, Sauron believes the hobbit has the ring, and is traveling to the city
                    of Gondor. This pressures him to attack before he is ready, resulting in the the death of the
                    Witch King, and eventually, the assault on the Black Gate, giving Frodo and Sam room to travel
                    to the volcano and destroy the ring (and Sauron himself).`,
                rohirrim: 'Most of the riders were women.',
                running: 'Aragorn had a broken toe. Legolas had cracked ribs. Gimli had a dislocated knee.',
                seventeen: `In the books, 17 years pass between the time Frodo receives the ring and leaves the shire.
                    The movies drastically speed up this timeline.`,
                saruman: `In the books, Saruman doesn't die at Orthanc. He dies in the Shire at the end of the third
                    book. Also, the death of Saruman is cut entirely from the theatrical cut of the movie. This actually
                    soured relations for years between the actor Christopher Lee, and the director Peter Jackson.`
