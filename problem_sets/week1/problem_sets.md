## Week 1 Problem Sets

### Hello, World
Implement a program that print `hello, world\n`

### Hello, It's Me
Implement a program that prompts the user for their name and then says `hello, <name>` to the user.For instance, 
if the user’s name is Adele, your program should print `hello, Adele\n`.

### Mario
#### Mario Stair
Implement a program that creates a pyramid using hashes(#) for bricks, following this pattern:
```
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```
But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:
```
  #
 ##
###
```
#### Mario Stairs With Gap
Implement a program that creates a pyramid using hashes(#) for brickes, following this pattern:
```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```
Allow the user to provide an int for the height of the pyramid.
### Cash and Credit
#### Cash
Suppose you work at a store and a customer gives you \$1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents). 
You’ll need to pay them their “change,” the amount leftover after paying for the cost of the candy. When making change, 
odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). 

Implement a program that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:
```
Change owed: 25
1
```
But prompt the user for an int greater than 0, so that the program works for any amount of change:
```
Change owed: 70
4
```
#### Credit
A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card 
is a number that’s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows 
whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express 
uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal numbers 
(0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 
unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)

Actually, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American 
Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other 
potential starting numbers which we won’t concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. 
But credit card numbers also have a “checksum” built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. 
That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, 
without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number 
that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.

#### Luhn's Algorithm
So what’s the secret formula? Well, most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:

    Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
    Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
    If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!

That’s kind of confusing, so let’s try an example with David’s Visa: 4003600000000014.

    Okay, let’s multiply every other digit by 2 (starting from the last number):

    1•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 6•2 + 0•2 + 4•2

    That gives us:

    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8

    Now let’s add those products’ digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:

    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13

    Now let’s add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):

    13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20

    Yup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so David’s card is legit!

So, validating credit card numbers isn’t hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let’s write a program.

#### Implementation Detail
Implement a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, 
MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. So that we can automate some tests of your code, 
we ask that your program’s last line of output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less. 
For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed 
on an actual card) and that it won’t have leading zeroes. But do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int!

Consider the below representative of how your own program should behave when passed a valid credit card number (sans hyphens).

```
$ ./credit
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

Now, get_long itself will reject hyphens (and more) anyway:
```
$ ./credit
Number: 4003-6000-0000-0014
Number: foo
Number: 4003600000000014
VISA
```

But it’s up to you to catch inputs that are not credit card numbers (e.g., a phone number), even if numeric:
```
$ ./credit
Number: 6176292929
INVALID
```

Test out your program with a bunch of inputs, both valid and invalid. Here are a few card numbers that [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/api/nvp-soap/payflow/integration-guide/test-transactions/#credit-card-numbers-for-testing) 
recommends for testing.
