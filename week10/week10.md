## Week 10 Problems
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/project/

Week 10 doesn't have problem sets. Instead, the last week is dedicated to creating a final project that utilises the
tools developed through the last 9 weeks. Some idea for a final project:
- a web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL
- an iOS app using Swift
- a game using Lua with LÖVE
- an Android app using Java
- a Chrome extension using JavaScript
- a command-line program using C
- a hardware-based application for which you program some device


At this point I've done all I wanted with CS50. I won't be developing a new project for week 10. Instead, I'll be
updating one of my self-hosted pages: https://studiopink.net
1. Migrate the backend from Go to Python for practice
2. Update the frontend with better styling
3. Add a new feature
